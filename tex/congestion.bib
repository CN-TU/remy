	doi = {10.1007/BF03346949},
	abstract = {Serum thyroglobulin (Tg), T4, T3, FT4, FT3, TSH concentrations and TSH response to iv TRH (delta TSH) were measured in 56 consecutive patients with (multi) nodular goiter from a severely iodine-deficient endemic goiter area in Northeastern Sicily and in 11 non goitrous euthyroid individuals living in the same area. Serum Tg concentrations were sharply increased in goitrous subjects (453 +/- 476 ng/ml) and related to thyroid size and the presence of nodules (chi 2 = 43.5, p less than 0.0005). Serum TSH levels measured in goitrous patients (2.1 +/- 0.9 microU/ml) were significantly lower than those measured in nongoitrous iodine deficient subjects (3.1 +/- 0.9 microU/ml, p less than 0.001) and decreased with increasing goiter size and nodularity (chi 2 = 27.3, p less than 0.05). A similar pattern was shown by the analysis of the delta TSH (chi 2 = 43.1, p less than 0.0005). These results suggest that at least a part of the largest and multinodular goiters become autonomously functioning with duration and growing in size. In 13 goitrous patients with absent or impaired response to TRH, a significant direct relation was apparent between log-Tg and goiter size and nodularity (r = 0.64) with an inverse relationship between serum FT3 and delta TSH (r = 0.73). A computed program analysis based on the combination of different independent variables (x) including age, thyroid size and nodularity, serum TSH, log-Tg and FT3, indicated the existence of a significant negative relationship between these variables and the TSH response to TRH (r = 0.75, p = 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},
