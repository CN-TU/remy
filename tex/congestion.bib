	doi = {10.1007/BF03346949},
	abstract = {Serum thyroglobulin (Tg), T4, T3, FT4, FT3, TSH concentrations and TSH response to iv TRH (delta TSH) were measured in 56 consecutive patients with (multi) nodular goiter from a severely iodine-deficient endemic goiter area in Northeastern Sicily and in 11 non goitrous euthyroid individuals living in the same area. Serum Tg concentrations were sharply increased in goitrous subjects (453 +/- 476 ng/ml) and related to thyroid size and the presence of nodules (chi 2 = 43.5, p less than 0.0005). Serum TSH levels measured in goitrous patients (2.1 +/- 0.9 microU/ml) were significantly lower than those measured in nongoitrous iodine deficient subjects (3.1 +/- 0.9 microU/ml, p less than 0.001) and decreased with increasing goiter size and nodularity (chi 2 = 27.3, p less than 0.05). A similar pattern was shown by the analysis of the delta TSH (chi 2 = 43.1, p less than 0.0005). These results suggest that at least a part of the largest and multinodular goiters become autonomously functioning with duration and growing in size. In 13 goitrous patients with absent or impaired response to TRH, a significant direct relation was apparent between log-Tg and goiter size and nodularity (r = 0.64) with an inverse relationship between serum FT3 and delta TSH (r = 0.73). A computed program analysis based on the combination of different independent variables (x) including age, thyroid size and nodularity, serum TSH, log-Tg and FT3, indicated the existence of a significant negative relationship between these variables and the TSH response to TRH (r = 0.75, p = 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {In statistics, a moving average (rolling average or running average) is a calculation to analyze data points by creating series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a moving mean (MM) or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter. Variations include: simple, and cumulative, or weighted forms (described below).
Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by "shifting forward"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.
A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly. For example, it is often used in technical analysis of financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes. It is also used in economics to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series. Mathematically, a moving average is a type of convolution and so it can be viewed as an example of a low-pass filter used in signal processing. When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.},
